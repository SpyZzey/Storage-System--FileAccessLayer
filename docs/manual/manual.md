# Introduction
The File Access Layer is a part of the Storage System made by [Simon Brebeck](https://www.simonbrebeck.de).

It is one of two parts of the Storage System, the other one being the 
[User Access Layer](https://github.com/SpyZzey/Storage-System--UserAccessLayer), which manages the
general user interface, the user management and the user permissions as well as the data encryption 
and database file entries.

The File Access Layer is responsible for the actual file storage and delivery
between the User Access Layer and the storage-servers.
